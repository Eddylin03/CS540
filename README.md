* Understand core techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including bag-of-words, tf-idf, n-Gram Models, and Smoothing.
* Understand the basics of Machine Learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Distinguish between regression and classification, and understand basic algorithms: Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes.
* Understand the basics of Neural Networks: Network Architecture, Training, Backpropagation, Stochastic Gradient Descent.
* Learn aspects of Deep Learning, including network architectures, convolution, training techniques.
* Understand the fundamentals of Game Theory.
* Understand how to formulate and solve several types of Search problems.

* Consider the applications and ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in real-world settings.


## Projects

* **Letter Frequency Analysis:** https://github.com/Eddylin03/CS540/blob/main/hw2/hw2.py - This script analyzes the frequency of letters in a given text file and uses Bayesian reasoning to determine if the text is more likely to be in English or Spanish. 
* **Facial Recognition with Eigenfaces::** https://github.com/Eddylin03/CS540/blob/main/hw3/Demonstration.ipynb - Implemented a facial recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify individuals from a dataset of facial images.
* **[...and so on...]**
