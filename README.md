## Projects

* **Letter Frequency Analysis:** https://github.com/Eddylin03/CS540/blob/main/hw2/hw2.py - This script analyzes the frequency of letters in a given text file and uses Bayesian reasoning to determine if the text is more likely to be in English or Spanish. 
* **[Project 2 Name]:** [Link to project 2 folder/files] - [Brief description of project 2]
* **[...and so on...]**
